    <h1>Skills To Enhance During This Lockdown</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Since the last lockdown, a survey was conducted where it was found that there are two
        types of people. One who in lethargic mode majorly procrastinate, and the others who
        
        use their time wisely. They are those people who have learned the concept of self-
        growth, who have done something productive like learning a new skill. These people
        
        have embraced themselves by learning new ideas about life and careers. Everyone
        who is reading this must be charged up and eager to know how to be productive,
        right? And voila, those who want to be skill full and learn new skills, have come to the
        right place because today you will know about some skills that you should learn
        during this lockdown.
   </p>

 </div>
   <br><br>
   
   <h3 > 1) Coding
       </h3>
   <br>
   <p>Well, coding is a high-demand skill in the market. These days we all have seen ads
    where 6-7 years old children are learning coding. I mean, literally, those who can't
    even speak alphabets in proper order are now learning this comprehensive computer
    programming. It is a great skill to comprehend since it improves not only your critical
    thinking, persistence, and problem-solving ability but also your C.V. Today in the
    market, an average salary of a coder is around <strong>$50000 per annum</strong>. So, what are you
    waiting for? Register yourself at Encodaid to avail this skill.
   </p>

    <br>
    <h3>2)App Development </h3>
    <p>
        Next, we have app development; if you have already learnt to code, it is just a piece of
        cake for you guys. If not, it is not a problem because it mainly focuses on design, user
        experience, and entertainment features. There is an old saying among app developers
        "Bring your idea to life and get set up for success!". App Development is another
        high-demand skill in the market. All the companies and aspiring entrepreneurs require
        this skill are willing to pay <strong>$60000 per year.</strong>
   </p>
   <img src="./img/b32.png" alt="" width="100%">
   <br>
   <h3>3) Web Designing</h3>
   <p>If you like app development skills but thinking it is too complex or tough to digest,
    then web designing is excellent for you. It is a simpler version of app development
    since no standard software development kit is required for building a website. I
    recommend this skill for those who have an artistic side but can't pursue it as a career
    for whatever reason; you can use it through this skill. In the current market, an
    average salary of a web developer starts from $42000.
   </p>
   <img src="./img/b33.png" alt="" width="100%">
   <br>
   <h3>4)Writing
   </h3>
   <p>Do you know how a person's work, personality, and learning are judged in society
    today? Through their writing, how they give words to their thoughts is checked on
    every level in society. It doesn't matter whether in college, workplace, or community;
    writing is one of the primary and essential skills for a person to learn. It is required in
    every field, and those who think what it is in writing to learn? Then let me tell you,
    writing is widely distributed like SEO copywriting, content writing, copywriting, and
    many more. A person who writes is great doesn't require a proper degree to earn, as a
    freelance, part-time, or full-time job, the pay in writing is high.</p>
   <img src="./img/b34.png" alt="" width="100%">
   <br>
   <h3>5) Graphical Designing </h3>
   <p>Another great skill for the artists breeds to showcase their talent to the world. Graphic
    Designing does not require any programming. In fact, only software like Adobe
    Photoshop, Illustrator, In-Design is enough to design your ideas. Almost every
    company in the world requires graphic designers with a salary ranges from $1500 to
    $3000 per month.
   </p>

   <h3>Conclusion
   </h3>
   <p>So, in the end, I would like to conclude that this lockdown can be a blessing or a
    nightmare; it just depends on you, how you utilize it. Honestly, lockdown is a great
    break that has come, so please try to use it as much as possible. And for those who,
