    <h1>Rape Culture and the Rescue of Technology</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Rape, the fourth most common crime against women in India. According to the 2020 annual reports of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the number of rape incidents in India per 100,000 citizens is 22,172. That means approximately 60 cases per day and every 2 cases per hour. In these cases, usually, the victims are teenage girls.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Just imagine how an innocent child who has just stepped into this world can ever recover from this incident? More than the child, imagine how the victim's family members could ever cope with this trauma? Do you guys remember Nirbhaya's case? A 23-year-old student died from injuries after being raped by six men on a moving bus.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    It's just one case that came into the limelight during that time. There are so many cases that didn't even get registered by the victim's family due to societal pressure. These things are every day in hearing, but the question is what to do about them? What are people and companies in the market doing to tackle this situation? Well, we can't tell for people, but as far as the companies are concerned, they have launched some gadgets that could help your child from these threats:

   <h3 > 1) SafeCity
       </h3>
   <br>
   <p>A good foundation of today for a better tomorrow. the SafeCity model leverages open-sourced data. Its database builds heatmaps and safe routes using Nearby Search, Directions API, and Grid Coverage techniques. Its platform acts as a crowd-sourced place where individuals can share their personal stories of sexual assaults and rapes.
   </p>
    <img src="./img/b51.png" alt="" width="100%">
    <br>
    <h3>2)Athena</h3>
    <p>
        A product dedicated to preventing physical assaults. Athena is a tiny circular device, about the size of two quarters, and can be pinned to a cloth, purse, or even worn as a necklace.  To activate Athena, the user presses on the device for three seconds. Athena joins via Bluetooth to the user's phone, sending an alert message to an emergency contact. Press it three times in quick succession to send a silent alert if you're suspicious of being targeted.
   </p>
   <img src="./img/b52.png" alt="" width="100%">
   <br>
   <h3>3) Undercover Colors</h3>
   <p>Choice Matter: A product to empower women to stop sexual assault. Undercover Colors are a nail polish that changes its color upon contact with a drink that contains Xanax, Rohypnol, or GHB, the drug most commonly used for date rape. For users to test to see if their drinks are safe will only a fingertip away.
   </p>
   <img src="./img/b53.png" alt="" width="100%">
   <br>
   <h3>4)Occly 
   </h3>
   <p>It is yet another product to make you feel safe from everywhere. This device can be quickly converted from a home security solution to a wearable safety device. It has four cameras that record your surroundings, a panic button, sirens, a microphone, Led Lighting, Bluetooth capabilities, and several automatic alarm sensors. The images recorded before and during the alarm are quickly sent to Occly 24-hour emergency support centre.</p>
   <img src="./img/b54.png" alt="" width="100%">
   <br>
   <h3>5) Safety Torch with Shock Effect</h3>
   <p>A rechargeable safety torch with a shock effect can be the saviour for women. The LED Flashlight with hidden electricity can shake a person very badly.  Such personal protective equipment should be considered as the must carry essential of women's bag.
   </p>
    <img src="./img/b55.png" alt="" width="100%">
   <br>
   <h3>6) Safety Torch with Shock Effect</h3>
   <p>It is vital to guard yourself, and what better weapon is a gun that sprayed pepper spray. This pistol is among the legally approved women's self-defense appliances. This spray act as an irritant that could affect the eyes and skin of the person. Always remember that two sprays are capable of affecting the attacker.
   </p>
    <img src="./img/b56.png" alt="" width="100%">
   <br>
   <h3>7) Safety Torch with Shock Effect</h3>
   <p>This self-defence product is geared towards active women. The heavy-duty plastic serrated-edge weapon is applied to and worn on your finger and can increase the user's odds of getting to safety in the event of an attack.
   </p>

   <br>
   <h3>Conclusion
   </h3>
   <p>In the end, I would like to emphasize that sexual violence poses an obstacle to peace and security. Many women lose their health, livelihoods, husbands, families, and support networks due to rape. The effects are devastating, extending beyond the initial victimization. Just think that every woman is someone's daughter, sister, wife, and mother; how would you feel if something like that happens to you. It is not easy to live in this society, but we can improve ourselves.
